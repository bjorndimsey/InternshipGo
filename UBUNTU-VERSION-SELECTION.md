## 💡 My Recommendation

### For Your InternshipGo Project:

**I recommend: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**

**Why:**
1. ✅ **Longer support** (until 2029 vs 2027)
2. ✅ **Latest features** and security updates
3. ✅ **Future-proof** - you won't need to upgrade soon
4. ✅ **Node.js 20.x** support is excellent
5. ✅ **Perfect for new deployments**

**However:**
- If your hosting provider only offers 22.04, that's perfectly fine too!
- Both versions will work identically for your project
- The difference is minimal for your use case

## 📋 What to Look For When Selecting

### In the Dropdown Menu:

✅ **Look for:**
- "Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS" (Best choice)
- "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS" (Also excellent)

⚠️ **Avoid:**
- Non-LTS versions (like 25.10, 25.04) - these have shorter support
- Desktop versions (unless you specifically need GUI)

### Key Terms:

- **LTS** = Long Term Support (what you want!)
- **Server** = Server edition (what you need!)
- **Desktop** = Desktop edition (not needed for servers)

---

## 🎯 Final Answer

**From the image you showed:**

The dropdown shows:
- ✅ Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Currently selected - **Perfect choice!**)
- ✅ Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Also available - **Also perfect!**)

**Both are correct!** 

**My recommendation:** 
- If **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** is available → **Choose it!**
- If only **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** is available → **That's also perfect!**

**You can't go wrong with either!** 🎉
